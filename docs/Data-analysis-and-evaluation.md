Since launching Article-Level Metrics, a number of different groups and individuals have independently analyzed different aspects of the dataset. Here are some projects that caught our attention.

* [The Spread of Scientific Information: insights from the web access statistics in PLoS Article-level Metrics Dataset](http://homes.gersteinlab.org/people/kkyan/Official_Page/plos_ana.html) Koon-Kiu Yan and Mark Gerstein, Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, U.S.A. This study empirically examines how papers published online gain popularity in the community and the rate of spread of information.
* [Mutable Mobiles: Online Journals and the Evolving Genre Ecosystem of Science](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07222009-144636/unrestricted/etd.pdf) Christian Casper, Department of Communication, Rhetoric and Digital Media, North Carolina State University, USA. This dissertation uses both quantitative and qualitative/critical methods to analyze possible new interactions between online texts that differ from those of print texts.
* [Analysis: Correlating the PLoS Article-level metrics](http://larsjuhljensen.wordpress.com/2010/01/15/analysis-correlating-the-plos-article-level-metrics/) Lars Juhl Jensen, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Copenhagen. This blog post analyses how various categories of metrics (such as bookmarks, blog posts, citations, downloads, ratings and trackbacks) correlate with each other. Interestingly, the author finds that after downloads, bookmarks have the next highest correlation with citations.
