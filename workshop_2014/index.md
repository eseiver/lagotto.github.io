<strong>Designing the Future</strong>
Our communities are recognizing the value of ALM in their work. As this happens, it is critical to ensure secure and reliable provision of data to support the whole ecosystem. To support our collective goals, a shared infrastructure is required to enable the diverse needs of funders, publishers, researchers and their institutions, and technology providers.

<strong>Purpose and Aims</strong>
The purpose of the workshop is to convene stakeholders across the research ecosystem to brainstorm the design of these systems. Over two days, we will create a map of the potential data flows between producers and consumers, shared infrastructure provision and value-add providers. In particular we will focus on the places where shared provision can support a range of downstream uses and help to create the transparency, governance and trust that will support widespread adoption.  On the third day, we will prototype ALM tools that support the new design proposed. 

<strong>Format</strong>
<br>
The program will be comprised of a series of interactive sessions that will contribute to the final output: a proposed map of the future ALM infrastructure.  It will primarily focus on functional and technical needs. Proposed topics include:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>ALM data exchange: establishing standard mechanisms for producers</li>
	<li>ALM data delivery: building friction-less channels for data access</li>
	<li>tools to facilitate retrieval and use of ALM data</li>
	<li>ALM ecosystem scaling/performance</li>
	<li>going beyond the article: linking and tracking the article with its associated objects (versions, preprints, data, software, posters, etc.)</li>
	<li>designing for trust: technical and functional elements needed for system credibility</li>
	<li>aligning interests across stakeholders: an exploration of reference models in the open source community</li>
</ul>
We welcome additional areas not covered by this list.

<strong>Logistics</strong>
On Dec 4-5, we will convene at Transparent House. Program begins at 9am each day and concludes around 4.30pm.  Please see the map below for location directions.  On Thursday and Friday, we have planned receptions following the last session each day.  The hackathon on Dec 6 will be held at the PLOS SF office.  

As this will be a small event, we encourage you to find accommodations that best suit your interests and needs.  Recommended hotels within walking distance are highlighted in red.
