## Overview

#### Article-Level Metrics measure the dissemination and reach of published research articles.

Traditionally, the impact of research articles has been measured by the publication journal. But a more informative view is one that examines the overall performance and reach of the articles themselves. Article-Level Metrics are a comprehensive set of impact indicators that enable numerous ways to assess and navigate research most relevant to the field itself, including:
* usage
* citations
* social bookmarking and dissemination activity
* media and blog coverage
* discussion activity and ratings
* recommendation reviews

<!-- [COUNTER 3](http://www.projectcounter.org/) maintains a defined list of robots that should be excluded in each publisher's usage reports.-->

Article-Level Metrics are available, upon publication, for every article published by PLOS. Researchers can stay up-to-date with their published work and share information about the impact of their publications with collaborators, funders, institutions, and the research community at large. These metrics are also a powerful way to navigate and discover others’ work. Metrics can be customized to address the needs of researchers, publishers, institutional decision-makers, or funders.

### Article-Level Metrics are useful to:
<a id="ALMvalue" name="ALMvalue"></a>

#### Researchers
* Track the impact of your research and share with others (funders, promotion boards, etc.)
* Navigate and filter research to find what is most suited to your needs
* Find collaborators based upon the impact of their work and relevance to yours
* Measure research impact with metrics at the article level, instead of at the traditional journal level
* Search, filter, and aggregate scholarly content based on research impact with metrics at the article level

#### Research Institutions
* Track dissemination of articles published (types of channels, rate of growth, etc.) by members of the institution
* Access up-to-date information on the research progress of faculty members, useful for tenure and promotion decisions
* View data on downstream impact of publications
* Roll up data for custom reporting of department’s research activities

#### Funders
* Efficiently track progress of the research impact of grant awardees in an automated fashion with the most relevant signals
* Measure research impact with metrics at the article level, instead of at the traditional journal level
* Measure evidence of wider engagement
* Monitor and enhance engagement from a specific audience
* Identify high-impact research outputs much earlier
* Analyze trends of past and future funding programs
* Conduct network analysis to evaluate researcher communities

#### Publishers
* Attract authors by offering data on the audience’s research interest
* Track dissemination of articles published (types of channels, rate of growth, etc.)
* Provide content distributors data on downstream impact of publications
* Gain comprehensive understanding of how publications are disseminated and accessed
* Report on the usage of the article in ways that suit your business needs
