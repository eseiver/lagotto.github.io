<h2>ALM</h2>
<p>Traditionally, the impact of research articles has been measured by the publication journal. But a more informative view is one that examines the overall performance and reach of the articles themselves. Article-Level Metrics capture the manifold ways in which research is disseminated as a set of impact indicators that enable numerous ways to assess and navigate research most relevant to the field itself, including:

<ul>
	<li>viewed</li>
	<li>cited</li>
	<li>shared</li>
	<li>discussed</li>
	<li>recommended.</li>
</ul>
 
These metrics offer a real-time view into the diverse ways in which the scholarly and public are engaging with the research. Researchers can stay up-to-date with their published work and share information about the impact of their publications with collaborators, funders, institutions, and the research community at large. These metrics are also a powerful way to navigate and discover othersâ€™ work. Metrics can be customized to address the needs of researchers, publishers, institutional decision-makers, or funders. </p>

<h2>ALM Application</h2>
<p>The ALM application collects and aggregates the data from external sources where article activity is occurring. It was developed in 2009 as an open source application by PLOS and is now implemented by a number of publishers and organizations.
