### JSON API snapshots

The snapshots of the Lagotto JSON API require the same ENV variables as the CSV export. Run `bundle exec rake api:snapshot:all` to create the snapshots and export them to Zenodo. More information is available in the `setup` documentation.

### Foreign keys

This release adds foreign keys (supported in Rails core since [Rails 4.2](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/12/19/Rails-4-2-final/)) to the database to enforce referential integrity.

### Registration agency checks

Some sources now check for the work registration agency, allowing different functionality, e.g. for CrossRef or DataCite DOIs.

### DataONE usage stats

This release adds two sources that collect usage stats from the DataONE repository network. The `dataone_counter` source collects COUNTER-compliant usage stats, whereas the `dataone_usage` source also includes machine usage from some useragents.
