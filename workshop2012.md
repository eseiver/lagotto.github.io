title: "ALM Workshop 2012"
---

Building off last year’s Beyond Impact Workshop; altmetrics11 &amp; 12; and a storm of activity they have since catalyzed, PLOS hosted  the 2012 ALM Workshop on November 1-3, 2012 in San Francisco. We convened various groups across the research ecosystem – researchers, institutions, publishers, funders, technology and service providers – for 3 days of collaborative breakout sessions amongst and between these groups.

<strong>Purpose and Aims:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Amplify awareness of social capital, mechanisms, and tools for using impact metrics that currently exist across target groups</li>
	<li>Discuss community-specific forms of measurable impact and examine convergence areas between audiences</li>
	<li>Cross-pollinate ideas between groups to better inform community-specific uses</li>
	<li>Coordinate plans for building best-practices, development of tools, and outreach/advocacy of altmetrics</li>
</ul>
<strong>Format: </strong>
We employed a blend of “unconference” and traditional programming.  As a group, we generated a list of issue topics of interest to the participants.  A smaller group, which coalesced during a clustering process, served as the basis for our first breakout session. The aim of S1 was to articulate a concrete problem statement for each topic.  The groups then generated an initial list of potential solutions in S2.  And from a subset of these solutions, the final session S3 aim was to design an action plan.

<strong>Possible Outcomes</strong>:
<ul>
	<li>Set of draft best practices (collection, display, and use) to serve as basis for future standards-building efforts</li>
	<li>Advocacy strategy for the publishing community with a list of potential candidates for ALM adoption</li>
	<li>Recommended practices and methodology for altmetrics-supported funding assessment</li>
	<li>Working groups organized with vision established for each group</li>
	<li>Prototypes of altmetrics tools to serve custom needs of each community</li>
</ul>
<strong>Final Deliverables</strong>:
Actionable plan for a small subset of solutions chosen by the group

<div></div>
<div><strong>Description:</strong>
<div>Uncover how science research is shared, used, and measured with altmetrics at the Altmetrics Hackathon on Nov 3, 2012 in San Francisco.  Altmetrics are online metrics that capture the many ways in which research articles are shared, commented, reviewed, and put to use.  As a set, they collectively tell the larger story of science.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Build new tools and improve existing ones with real time datasets and API services.  Create new mashups.  Brainstorm the future of tracking science.  Fun prizes awarded at the end of the session.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJixj2z6oSpFIosQQlGXFbrOBLR8te3VZgzdvcMedTA/edit#">View ideas and share your own here</a>.</div>

<div><strong>Purpose and Aims</strong>:
<ul>
	<li>Identify Problems: Convene the community to articulate and concretize technical issues and challenges in the application of altmetrics data</li>
	<li>Collaborate (hack): Explore and begin building solutions for these needs -</li>
<ul>
	<li>Improve existing applications: PLOS ALM, ImpactStory, ScienceCard</li>
	<li>Make new standalone applications</li>
	<li>Work on something that integrates the different ALM apps, e.g. a source interesting to all of them, a mashup with data from different tools</li>
</ul>
	<li>Raise Awareness: Seed concrete ideas and raise awareness amongst the user groups (funders, publishers, researchers, administrators) of the potential for tools to -</li>
<ul>
	<li>Advance adoption of altmetrics within each target group and across research ecosystem</li>
	<li>Address specific pain/friction points which lower barriers to adoption of altmetrics use cases</li>
</ul>
