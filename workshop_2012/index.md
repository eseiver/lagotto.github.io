Building off last year’s Beyond Impact Workshop; altmetrics11 &amp; 12; and a storm of activity they have since catalyzed, PLOS hosted the 2012 ALM Workshop on November 1-3, 2012 in San Francisco. We convened various groups across the research ecosystem – researchers, institutions, publishers, funders, technology and service providers – for 3 days of collaborative breakout sessions amongst and between these groups. The workshop wrapped on the last day with the <a href="http://articlemetrics.github.io/workshop_2012/hackathon/">Altmetrics Hackathon</a>.

<strong>Purpose and Aims</strong>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Amplify awareness of social capital, mechanisms, and tools for using impact metrics that currently exist across target groups</li>
	<li>Discuss community-specific forms of measurable impact and examine convergence areas between audiences</li>
	<li>Cross-pollinate ideas between groups to better inform community-specific uses</li>
	<li>Coordinate plans for building best-practices, development of tools, and outreach/advocacy of altmetrics</li>
</ul>
<strong>Format</strong>
<br>
We employed a blend of “unconference” and traditional programming.  As a group, we generated a list of issue topics of interest to the participants.  A smaller group, which coalesced during a clustering process, served as the basis for our first breakout session. The aim of this session was to articulate a concrete problem statement for each topic.  The groups then generated an initial list of potential solutions in the second session.  And from a subset of these solutions, the final session was aimed at designing an action plan.

<strong>Final Outputs</strong>
