Saturday, we (MF) will be addressing this very question at the SpotOn
London conference with <a href="http://twitter.com/pixievondust">Marie Boran</a>,
<a href="http://www.dcscience.net/">David Colquhoun</a>, <a href="http://www.altmetric.com/blog/">Jean

discussion on the role of altmetrics in evaluating scientific research,
we offer our views from a historical perspective.</p>

<p><img src="/images/number_17.jpg" alt="Flickr photo by
[szczel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/57976131@N00/4489011281/)."> In the last few decades,
research has grown from an activity of a
relative small number of academics working alone or in small groups into
a large-scale operation that involves large numbers of people and money.
One of the consequences of this trend is the increasing difficulty of
making decisions about acceptance for publication, academic positions,
and grant funding. If you work in a relatively obscure field such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_S._Carberry">psychoceramics</a>, you
might know the work of everyone in this field, but that is no longer
true for research fields such as the <em>genetics of breast cancer</em>. The
trend is only increasing towards Big Science. High-energy physics
provides an easy example as <a href="http://river-valley.tv/tag/salvatore-mele/">Salvatore
Mele</a> from <em>CERN</em> will
discuss in his SpotOn London keynote: <strong><a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-keynote-1-boson-50-years-50003-scientists-understanding-our-universe-through-global-scientific-collaboration-and-open-access/">1 boson, 50 years, 50,003
scientists: understanding our universe through global scientific
collaboration and Open
Access</a></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">I. Modern peer review begins…</h3>

<p>Around the beginning of the Higgs boson adventure, the state of
scholarly communications looked quite different. Peer review was only
introduced relatively recently to solve this problem. It is often
overlooked that the famous <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf">Watson and Crick paper on the structure of
DNA</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/dmm.001388">wasn’t peer
reviewed</a> in 1953. The journal
<em>Nature</em> implemented peer review during this decade. Journal editors
were increasingly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of research papers
submitted and by the increasing specialization of science, and they
needed help from subject area experts to make publication decisions. We
think it is likely also that universities and research funders really
began to rely on external peer review to help make decisions sometime
around this era as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/number_6.jpg" alt="Flickr photo by
[LEOL30](http://www.flickr.com/photos/49968232@N00/7804231764/)"> Peer review
does not <em>measure*the quality of research but rather is a
subjective evaluation aimed at a specific end, whether it be journal
publication or proposed grant award decision-making. In the best case,
the process works well. However, most universities, journals, and
funders do not have the resources to do this properly. Amy Brand
(<a href="http://www.faculty.harvard.edu/about-office/our-team">Assistant Provost for Faculty Appointments and
Information</a>) has
<a href="http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/files/2013/10/Brand.pptx">spoken about</a>
the Harvard University process of faculty appointments at the recent ALM
workshop. It was clear that their elaborate and labor-intensive review
process seems to work well for them but isn’t easily translated to
smaller institutions or those without dedicated resources governing and
running this process. In the worst case as a subjective evaluation, peer
review can actually be harmful. Walker-Eyre and Stoletzki’s <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001675">recent
analysis in PLOS
Biology</a> showed little
correlation between the subjective assessment of merit in the datasets
they studied and conclude that </em>subjective assessments are an
error-prone, biased, and expensive method by which to assess merit*.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">II. … And then bibliometrics enters…</h3>

<p><img src="/images/number_3003.jpg" alt="Flickr photo by
[magannie](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24453920@N00/214486419/)"> To overcome
the subjectivity and other limitations of peer review, we
increasingly began to use bibliometrics such as citation counts in the
1970s. As quality of research cannot be directly measured, bibliometrics
created a construct of impact based on how research is perceived and
consumed by the scientific community. Citations in the scholarly
literature were used as this proxy, and higher citation counts were
constructed to represent higher scientific impact. This construct has
two major limitations: a conceptual one (by using impact as a proxy for
quality, we create undesired incentives) and a practical one (citation
counts are influenced by many other factors, e.g discipline). It has
given birth to unintended and undesired consequences, of which a
principal one is the privileging of things that can be measured with
this construct (namely, journal articles instead of other research
outputs as well as research that is more likely to be cited).</p>

<p>One of the first bibliometric indicators that became widely used was the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor">Journal Impact Factor</a>. The
decision to focus on the journal and not the individual article were
rooted in practical and environmental reasons no longer applicable.
Counting citations was painful manual work before digital publishing
became the norm in the 1990s. We also didn’t have norms for uniquely
identifying journals articles until DOIs were introduced in the 2000s.
The short citation window and document type asymmetry were also due to
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/StefanieHaustein/haustein-asist-panel">concerns for
cost-efficiency</a>.
Today, there are many reasons for why <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/article-level-metrics-learning-to-walk-run-do-algebra/">using the Journal Impact factor
for individual level bibliometrics are a bad
idea</a>.
Panelist Stephen Curry’s remarks on the subject are particularly well
communicated here: <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/">Sick of Impact
Factors</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">III. What next? ALM, Altmetrics, but we also need more</h3>

<p>These two historical moments provide some background as to how we have
arrived at the current state. But separate from this narrative, we
believe that quality of research is something that really can’t be fully
captured or measured in numbers. This is true for all creative work
(<a href="http://m.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/11/should-literature-be-useful.html">including
literature</a>)
and should come as no surprise to anyone involved in research endeavors.</p>

<p>But should we stop right here, give up, and go back to our business of
doing science? In the last few years, three important trends have begun
to pave a way out of the current muck and change how we use
bibliometrics:</p>

<ul>
<li>  metrics for individual articles instead of journal-based metrics</li>
<li>  metrics that go beyond citations, including usage statistics and
social media activity</li>
<li>  metrics for research outputs other than journal articles</li>
</ul>

<p>These trends have been summarized with the terms a<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687">rticle-level
metrics</a> and
<a href="http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics</a> and will be the focus of
the panel next Saturday. As altmetrics is still a young discipline, more
work needs to be done before they become part of mainstream
bibliometrics. That said, the <a href="http://www.issi2013.org/programme.html">number of altmetrics presentations at the
latest international bibliometrics
conference</a> (with the <a href="http://www.wlv.ac.uk/default.aspx?page=35163">Eugene
Garfield Doctoral Dissertation Scholarship for 2013 awarded to Ehsan
Mohammadi</a> for altmetrics
work), as well as the July 2013 Sloan grant for <a href="http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/altmetrics_initiative/">NISO to develop
altmetrics standards and best
practices</a> are
good indicators that the prefix “alt-” might not be meaningful much
longer.</p>

<p>We can use altmetrics to overcome many of the shortcomings of
citation-based bibliometrics currently in use, and the <a href="http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLOS
Article-Level Metrics</a> project
has always been an important part of this change. We and others are
working on <a href="https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm">open source tools that make it affordable for everyone to
collect article-level metrics</a>,
better tools to <a href="http://almreports.plos.org">analyze and visualize article-level
metrics</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.04">standards for grouping metrics
into categories</a>,
<a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/alm-data-challenge-metrics-for-a-standard-set-of-dois/">standards for data collection</a>,
and more. We are positive that we will make good progress developing
these new metrics in the coming years, but they will not solve the
problem we started out with: *The quality of research is something that
can’t be measured in numbers.*</p>

<p>The <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001677"><em>PLOS Biology</em> editorial</a> discussing
the <em>PLOS Biology</em> paper by Walker-Eyre and Stoletzki goes into a bit
more detail discussing the concept of <strong>merit</strong>, saying that <em>merit
is not a single measurable quantity</em> and that we should <em>identify
multivariate metrics that are more appropriate to 21st Century
science.</em> Maybe we should go one step further: altmetrics are a big
improvement over traditional journal-based metrics and over subjective
evaluation by a handful of peers, but at the end of the day they are
still a construct that measures something different. We should therefore
be painfully aware of unintended consequences, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>  we create incentives for researchers to do things that “count” and
to not engage in activities that “don’t count”</li>
<li>  we spend more and more time evaluating research rather than doing
and discussing research.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have the opportunity to address both of these issues as well as
continue to reconsider how our assessment activities represent our
values as a research community. The methods of evaluation always
implicitly reflect some set of ideas about what is important (and what
is not). Whether they are ones we would explicitly embrace or ones that
disappoint… <em>that is up to all of us in the research community.</em></p>
